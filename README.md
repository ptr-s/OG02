### branch manipulation

***GitHub*** had been using its own variant of Markdown since as early as 2009,[37] which added support for additional formatting such as tables and nesting block content inside list elements, as well as ***GitHub***-specific features such as auto-linking references to commits, issues, usernames, etc.

In 2017, ***GitHub*** released a formal specification<br/>  of its ***GitHub*** Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark.[31] It is a strict superset of CommonMark, following its specification exactly except for tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists, which GFM adds as extensions.[38]
